# Ruby Chess

## Description
This is my submission for the final assignment of TheOdinProject's ruby unit. It is a fully functional chess game played inside the terminal. All moves and rules from regular chess apply, including castling, pawn double moving on the first, etc.

## Usage
The initial player will chose a color. Players will then alternate taking turns, moving thier pieces by typing the source and destination coordinates. The game ends when a player is in checkmate
